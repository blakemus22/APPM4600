This is my APPM 4600, Numerical Methods and Scientific computing repository. There are two folders, one for homework and one for labs. The homework folder contains code snippets, not the full homework files. The lab folder contains all the lab exercises, which will be hands-on activities to help us learn from numerical methods and scientific computing.
